Tracking Privacy Risks in Android Applications

This project investigates privacy risks in Android applications through static taint analysis, focusing on how potentially sensitive data may flow from device APIs to storage or network endpoints. Using Amandroid, a static analysis framework for Android, a curated set of real-world APKs was analyzed to identify sources (e.g., location, microphone, device identifiers) and sinks (e.g., file system and network communication).

The primary goals of the project were to:

Understand how Android applications handle user data at the code level

Identify potential privacy leaks through source-to-sink data flows

Gain hands-on experience with empirical software security analysis tools

--Methodology--

Static Analysis Tool: Amandroid

Dataset: 10 Android applications (6 successfully analyzed due to hardware limitations)

Sources Examined:

Geolocation APIs

Microphone access APIs

Device identifier APIs

Sinks Examined:

Local file storage

Network communication

A custom Python script was developed to automatically parse Amandroid’s taint analysis output and categorize detected sources and sinks using predefined keyword signatures. The results were aggregated into a summary table and visualized for comparison across applications.

--Key Findings--

No taint paths were detected from sensitive sources (location, microphone, device ID) to network sinks in the analyzed apps.

Detected taint paths primarily involved file sinks, which aligned with expected app behavior (e.g., saving user-generated content).

Some applications showed network activity not detected by Amandroid due to obfuscation or third-party SDKs. These flows were identified through manual inspection of decompiled source code, highlighting limitations of static analysis tools.

Observed data flows were consistent with the apps’ published privacy policies and EULAs, suggesting no undisclosed or unjustified data collection.

--Tools & Technologies--

Amandroid (static taint analysis)

Python (automation, data parsing, CSV generation)

Pandas (data aggregation)

APK decompilation for manual verification

Android privacy policy and EULA analysis

--Takeaways--

This project demonstrates how static analysis can be used to assess mobile app privacy while also illustrating its limitations when dealing with obfuscated code and third-party libraries. Combining automated taint analysis with manual code inspection provides a more complete picture of real-world Android app behavior.
