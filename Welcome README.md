## 🔬 Featured Technical Research

### [Network Architecture & Virtual Routing Platforms](link-to-repo)
A deep-dive analysis of enterprise and service-provider virtual routers. 
* **Focus:** Comparison of Control-Plane vs. Data-Plane behavior in x86-based environments.
* **Outcome:** Identified performance bottlenecks in hybrid-cloud transit hubs and optimized encapsulation strategies for GRE/IPsec.

### [External Attack Surface Audit & Passive Recon](link-to-repo)
A non-intrusive infrastructure audit of a large-scale academic network.
* **Focus:** ASN peering, DNS governance, and Shadow IT discovery.
* **Key Insight:** Documented the "Visibility Gap" in IPv6 address spaces and proposed alternative discovery methods via Certificate Transparency.

### [Linux Sandbox Isolation & Least Privilege Analysis](link-to-repo)
Security research into Flatpak architectures and system-level isolation.
* **Focus:** Demonstrated sandbox escape vectors in X11-based environments.
